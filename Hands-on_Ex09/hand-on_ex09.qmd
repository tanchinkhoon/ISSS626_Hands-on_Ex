# 17 Modelling Geographical Accessibility

## 17.1 Introduction

In this exercise you will learn to model geographical accessibility in R using packages for simple features, mapping and accessibility computation. You will prepare the data, compute accessibility with three methods and create maps and boxplots to interpret the results.

### 17.1.1 Learning outcomes

-   Import GIS polygon and point data into R as simple feature objects using sf functions

-   Import a distance matrix and prepare it for modelling

-   Compute accessibility using Hansen, KD2SFCA and Spatial Accessibility Measure methods

-   Visualise results with `tmap` and `ggplot2`

## 17.2 The data

Four data sets are used in this exercise, they are:

-   `MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL`: URA Master Plan 2014 subzone boundary GIS data. This data set is downloaded from data.gov.sg.

-   `hexagons`: A 250m radius hexagons GIS data. This data set was created by using st_make_grid() of sf package. It is in ESRI shapefile format.

-   `ELDERCARE`: GIS data showing location of eldercare service. This data is downloaded from data.gov.sg. There are two versions. One in ESRI shapefile format. The other one in Google kml file format. For the purpose of this hands-on exercise, ESRI shapefile format is provided.

    -   `OD_Matrix`: a distance matrix in csv format. There are six fields in the data file. They are:
    -   `origin_id`: the unique id values of the origin (i.e. `fid` of hexagon data set.),
    -   `destination_id`: the unique id values of the destination (i.e. `fid` of `ELDERCARE` data set.),
    -   `entry_cost`: the perpendicular distance between the origins and the nearest road),
    -   `network_cost`: the actual network distance from the origin and destination,
    -   `exit_cost`: the perpendicular distance between the destination and the nearest road), and
    -   `total_cost`: the summation of `entry_cost`, `network_cost` and `exit_cost`.

::: callout-note
Except `MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL` data set, the other three data set are specially prepared by Prof. Kam for teaching and research purpose. Students taking IS415 Geospatial Analytics and Applications are allowed to use them for hands-on exercise purpose. Please obtain formal approval from Prof. Kam if you want to use them for other courses or usage.
:::

## 17.3 Getting Started

Install and load required packages. The code uses `pacman::p_load()` to install on demand and load in one step.

```{r}

# install and load required packages in one call
pacman::p_load(tmap, SpatialAcc, sf,            # mapping, accessibility, simple features
               ggstatsplot, reshape2,           # statistical graphics, data reshaping
               tidyverse)  

```

## 17.4 Geospatial data wrangling

### 17.4.1 Importing geospatial data

Three geospatial data will be imported from the **data/geospatial** sub-folder. They are MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL, hexagons and ELDERCARE.

The code chunk below is used to import these three data sets shapefile by using `st_read()` of **sf** packages.

```{r}

# read URA subzones as simple features
mpsz <- st_read(dsn = "/Users/cktan/Desktop/SMU/01_Geospatial Analytics (ISSS626)/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex09/data/geospatial", layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL")   # polygon layer

```

```{r}

# read hexagon grid as simple features
hexagons <- st_read(dsn = "/Users/cktan/Desktop/SMU/01_Geospatial Analytics (ISSS626)/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex09/data/geospatial", layer = "hexagons") # polygon grid


```

```{r}

# read eldercare locations as simple features
eldercare <- st_read(dsn = "/Users/cktan/Desktop/SMU/01_Geospatial Analytics (ISSS626)/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex09/data/geospatial", layer = "ELDERCARE")            # point layer

```

The report above shows that the R object used to contain the imported MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile is called *mpsz* and it is a simple feature object. The geometry type is *multipolygon*. it is also important to note that mpsz simple feature object does not have EPSG information.

### 17.4.2 Updating CRS information

The code chunk below updates the newly imported mpsz with the correct ESPG code (i.e. 3414)

```{r}

# transform layers to EPSG 3414 for consistent units in metres
mpsz <- st_transform(mpsz, 3414)           # subzones to SVY21 Singapore TM
eldercare <- st_transform(eldercare, 3414) # eldercare points to SVY21 Singapore TM
hexagons <- st_transform(hexagons, 3414)   # hexagon grid to SVY21 Singapore TM

```

After transforming the projection metadata, you can verify the projection of the newly transformed ***mpsz_svy21*** by using `st_crs()` of sf package.

The code chunk below will be used to verify the newly transformed ***mpsz_svy21***.

```{r}

# verify the CRS of the subzones object
st_crs(mpsz)

```

Notice that the EPSG: is indicated as \***3414** now.

### 17.4.3 Cleaning and updating attribute fields of the geospatial data

There are many redundant fields in the data tables of both `eldercare` and `hexagons`. The code chunks below will be used to exclude those redundant fields. At the same time, a new field called `demand` and a new field called `capacity` will be added into the data table of `hexagons` and `eldercare` sf data frame respectively. Both fields are derive using `mutate()` of **dplyr** package.

```{r}

# keep only id and address then add constant capacity field for supply locations
eldercare <- eldercare %>%
  select(fid, ADDRESSPOS) %>%   # retain unique id and address
  mutate(capacity = 100)        # placeholder capacity for each facility

```

```{r}

# keep only id then add constant demand field for each hexagon cell
hexagons <- hexagons %>%
  select(fid) %>%       # retain unique id of each grid cell
  mutate(demand = 100)  # placeholder demand for each cell

```

Notice that for the purpose of this hands-on exercise, a constant value of 100 is used. In practice, actual demand of the hexagon and capacity of the eldercare centre should be used.

## 17.5 Apsaital Data Handling and Wrangling

### 17.5.1 Importing Distance Matrix

The code chunk below uses `read_cvs()` of **readr** package to import `OD_Matrix.csv` into RStudio. The imported object is a tibble data.frame called `ODMatrix`.

```{r}

# import distance matrix as a tibble
ODMatrix <- read_csv("/Users/cktan/Desktop/SMU/01_Geospatial Analytics (ISSS626)/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex09/data/aspatial/OD_Matrix.csv", skip = 0)  # columns include origin, destination and costs

```

### 17.5.2 Tidying distance matrix

The imported ODMatrix organised the distance matrix columnwise.

![](1.png)

On the other hands, most of the modelling packages in R is expecting a matrix look similar to the figure below.

![](2.png)

The rows represent **origins** (i.e. also know as **from** field) and the columns represent **destination** (i.e. also known as **to** field.)

The code chunk below uses `spread()` of **tidyr** package is used to transform the O-D matrix from a thin format into a fat format.

```{r}

# build a wide distance matrix using total_cost
# select needed columns then spread destination ids to wide columns
# finally drop the origin_id column once it has become the row id

distmat <- ODMatrix %>%
  select(origin_id, destination_id, total_cost) %>%  # pick the three fields we need
  spread(destination_id, total_cost) %>%    # convert thin table to wide table by destination
  select(c(-c('origin_id')))                # remove origin id column after spreading

```

::: callout-note
Since tidyr version 1.0 a new function called `pivot_wider()` is introduce. You should use `pivot_wider()` instead of `spread()`
:::

Currently, the distance is measured in metre because SVY21 projected coordinate system is used. The code chunk below will be used to convert the unit f measurement from metre to kilometre.

```{r}

# convert metres to kilometres and coerce to numeric matrix
distmat_km <- as.matrix(distmat / 1000)              # numeric matrix required by SpatialAcc::ac

```

## 17.6 Modelling and Visualising Accessibility using Hansen Method

### 17.6.1 Computing Hansen's accessibility

Now, we ready to compute Hansen's accessibility by using `ac()` of **SpatialAcc** package. Before getting started, you are encourage to read the **arguments** of the function at least once in order to ensure that the required inputs are available.

The code chunk below calculates Hansen's accessibility using `ac()` of **SpatialAcc** and `data.frame()` is used to save the output in a data frame called **acc_Handsen**.

```{r}

# compute Hansen accessibility values per origin cell
acc_Hansen <- data.frame(ac(hexagons$demand,     # vector of origin demands
                            eldercare$capacity,  # vector of destination capacities
                            distmat_km,          # distance matrix in kilometres
                            #d0 = 50,            # optional cut off distance in kilometres if needed
                            power = 2,           # distance decay parameter for Hansen
                            family = "Hansen"))  # choose the Hansen method

```

The default field name is very messy, we will rename it to `accHansen` by using the code chunk below.

```{r}

# rename the single output column to a tidy name
colnames(acc_Hansen) <- "accHansen"              # set a clear column name

```

Next, we will convert the data table into tibble format by using the code chunk below.

```{r}

# convert to tibble for nicer printing and dplyr friendliness
acc_Hansen <- as_tibble(acc_Hansen)               # tibble retains numeric vector with column name

```

Lastly, `bind_cols()` of dplyr will be used to join the `acc_Hansen` tibble data frame with the hexagons simple feature data frame. The output is called **hexagon_Hansen**.

```{r}

# attach the accessibility values to the hexagon sf object
hexagon_Hansen <- bind_cols(hexagons, acc_Hansen) # geometry from hexagons plus new column

```

Notice that hexagon_Hansen is a simple feature data frame and not a typical tibble data frame.

![](3.png)

We can also run the entire sequence in one block as shown next. This alternative uses a different power value as demonstrated in the source.

```{r}

# alternate single block version as shown in the source
acc_Hansen <- data.frame(ac(hexagons$demand,     # origin demand
                            eldercare$capacity,  # destination capacity
                            distmat_km,          # distance matrix in kilometres
                            #d0 = 50,           # optional cut off
                            power = 0.5,         # alternate decay value used in the example
                            family = "Hansen"))  # Hansen method

colnames(acc_Hansen) <- "accHansen"              # tidy column name
acc_Hansen <- as_tibble(acc_Hansen)               # convert to tibble
hexagon_Hansen <- bind_cols(hexagons, acc_Hansen) # join to geometry

```

### 17.6.2 Visualising Hansen's accessibility

#### 17.6.2.1 Extracting map extent

Firstly, we will extract the extend of **hexagons** simple feature data frame by by using `st_bbox()` of sf package.

```{r}

# compute map extent once for reuse
mapex <- st_bbox(hexagons) 

```

The code chunk below uses a collection of mapping fucntions of tmap package to create a high cartographic quality accessibility to eldercare centre in Singapore.

```{r}

# choropleth of Hansen accessibility with facility locations overlaid

tm_shape(hexagon_Hansen, bbox = mapex) +           # set the data and map extent
  tm_polygons(fill = "accHansen",                 # fill by accessibility field
              fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(     # classify values into intervals
                style = "quantile",               # equal number of cells per class
                n = 10,                            # ten classes
                values = "brewer.blues")) +       # blue palette
  tm_shape(eldercare) +                            # overlay supply points
  tm_dots(size = 0.3,                              # small dot size for points
          fill = "red",                           # red fill for emphasis
          col = "black") +                        # black outline
  tm_title("Accessibility to eldercare  Hansen method") +  # map title
  tm_layout(frame = TRUE) +                        # draw a neatline frame
  tm_compass(type = "8star", size = 2) +          # compass for orientation
  tm_scalebar() +                                  # scale bar in map units
  tm_grid(alpha = 0.2)        

```

### 17.6.3 Statistical graphic visualisation

In this section, we are going to compare the distribution of Hansen's accessibility values by URA Planning Region.

Firstly, we need to add the planning region field into haxegon_Hansen simple feature data frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}

# spatial join to append region name to each hexagon
hexagon_Hansen <- st_join(hexagon_Hansen, mpsz, join = st_intersects)  # brings REGION_N into the grid

```

Next, `ggplot()` will be used to plot the distribution by using boxplot graphical method.

```{r}

# boxplot of log accessibility by planning region

ggplot(data = hexagon_Hansen,    # use the joined sf object
       aes(y = log(accHansen),   # log scale for the response
           x = REGION_N)) +      # planning region on x axis
  geom_boxplot() +               # draw boxplots per region
  geom_point(stat = "summary",   # add mean points
             fun.y = "mean",     # function is mean
             colour = "red",     # red mean marker
             size = 2)           # marker size

```

## 17.7 Modelling and visualising accessibility using KD2SFCA method

### 17.7.1 Computing KD2SFCA's accessibility

In this section, you are going to repeat most of the steps you had learned in previous section to perform the analysis. However, some of the codes will be combined into one code chunk.

The code chunk below calculates Hansen's accessibility using ac() of **SpatialAcc** and `data.frame()` is used to save the output in a data frame called **acc_KD2SFCA**. Notice that **KD2SFCA** is used for family argument.

```{r}

# compute KD2SFCA accessibility with a five kilometre catchment and power two
acc_KD2SFCA <- data.frame(ac(hexagons$demand,     # origin demand
                             eldercare$capacity,  # destination capacity
                             distmat_km,          # distance matrix in kilometres
                             d0 = 5,              # catchment threshold in kilometres
                             power = 2,           # decay parameter
                             family = "KD2SFCA")) # KD2SFCA method

# tidy column name and bind to geometry
colnames(acc_KD2SFCA) <- "accKD2SFCA"               # set column name
acc_KD2SFCA <- as_tibble(acc_KD2SFCA)               # tibble for convenience
hexagon_KD2SFCA <- bind_cols(hexagons, acc_KD2SFCA) # join to hexagon geometry

```

### 17.7.2 Visualising KD2SFCA's accessibility

The code chunk below uses a collection of mapping fucntions of tmap package to create a high cartographic quality accessibility to eldercare centre in Singapore. Notice that **mapex** is reused for bbox argument.

```{r}

# map of KD2SFCA accessibility using the same extent and palette

tm_shape(hexagon_KD2SFCA, bbox = mapex) +        # reuse map extent
  tm_polygons(fill = "accKD2SFCA",               # fill by KD2SFCA field
              fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(   # classification settings
                style = "quantile",              # quantile style
                n = 10,                          # ten classes
                values = "brewer.blues")) +      # palette
  tm_shape(eldercare) +                          # overlay supply points
  tm_dots(size = 0.3, fill = "red", col = "black") +  # style points
  tm_title("Accessibility to eldercare  KD2SFCA method") +
  tm_layout(frame = TRUE) +
  tm_compass(type = "8star", size = 2) +
  tm_scalebar() +
  tm_grid(alpha = 0.2)

```

### 17.7.3 Statistical graphic visualisation

Now, we are going to compare the distribution of KD2CFA accessibility values by URA Planning Region.

Firstly, we need to add the planning region field into hexagon_KD2SFCA simple feature data frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}

# append region names then plot distribution by region
hexagon_KD2SFCA <- st_join(hexagon_KD2SFCA, mpsz, join = st_intersects)  # add REGION_N

```

Next, ggplot() will be used to plot the distribution by using boxplot graphical method.

```{r}

ggplot(data = hexagon_KD2SFCA,  # KD2SFCA results
       aes(y = accKD2SFCA,      # response on original scale
           x = REGION_N)) +     # planning region
  geom_boxplot() +              # boxplots
  geom_point(stat = "summary",  # mean markers
             fun.y = "mean",    # mean function
             colour = "red",    # red mean marker
             size = 2)          # size of marker

```

## 17.8 Modelling and visualising accessibility using Spatial Accessibility Measure (SAM) method

### 17.8.1 Computing SAM accessibility

In this section, you are going to repeat most of the steps you had learned in previous section to perform the analysis. However, some of the codes will be combined into one code chunk.

The code chunk below calculates Hansen's accessibility using `ac()` of **SpatialAcc** and `data.frame()` is used to save the output in a data frame called **acc_SAM**. Notice that **SAM** is used for family argument.

```{r}

# compute SAM accessibility with the same catchment and decay as KD2SFCA
acc_SAM <- data.frame(ac(hexagons$demand,     # origin demand
                         eldercare$capacity,  # destination capacity
                         distmat_km,          # distance matrix in kilometres
                         d0 = 5,              # catchment in kilometres
                         power = 2,           # decay parameter
                         family = "SAM"))     # SAM method

# tidy column name and bind to geometry
colnames(acc_SAM) <- "accSAM"                 # set column name
acc_SAM <- as_tibble(acc_SAM)                 # tibble form
hexagon_SAM <- bind_cols(hexagons, acc_SAM)   # join to geometry

```

### 17.8.2 Visualising SAM's accessibility

The code chunk below uses a collection of mapping fucntions of tmap package to create a high cartographic quality accessibility to eldercare centre in Singapore. Notice that **mapex** is reused for bbox argument.

```{r}

# map of SAM accessibility

tm_shape(hexagon_SAM, bbox = mapex) +           # reuse extent
  tm_polygons(fill = "accSAM",                  # fill by SAM field
              fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(  # classify into intervals
                style = "quantile",             # quantile style
                n = 10,                         # ten classes
                values = "brewer.blues")) +     # palette
  tm_shape(eldercare) +                         # overlay points
  tm_dots(size = 0.3, fill = "red", col = "black") +  # style points
  tm_title("Accessibility to eldercare  SAM method") +
  tm_layout(frame = TRUE) +
  tm_compass(type = "8star", size = 2) +
  tm_scalebar() +
  tm_grid(alpha = 0.2)

```

### 17.8.3 Statistical graphic visualisation

Now, we are going to compare the distribution of SAM accessibility values by URA Planning Region.

Firstly, we need to add the planning region field into hexagon_SAM simple feature data frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}

# append region names then plot distribution by region
hexagon_SAM <- st_join(hexagon_SAM, mpsz, join = st_intersects)   # add REGION_N

```

Next, `ggplot()` will be used to plot the distribution by using boxplot graphical method.

```{r}

ggplot(data = hexagon_SAM,      # SAM results
       aes(y = accSAM,          # response on original scale
           x = REGION_N)) +     # planning region
  geom_boxplot() +              # boxplots
  geom_point(stat = "summary",  # mean marker
             fun.y = "mean",    # use mean
             colour = "red",    # red mean
             size = 2)          # marker size

```
